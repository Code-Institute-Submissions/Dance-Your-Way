## UX

##### User Stories

- "As an event organiser, I want to post details about my events, so I can get more customers"
- "As a dancer, I want to view information about events in my city, so I can plan where to go for class"

##### Design Choices

- List of design choices

##### Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create detailed wireframes for each page at a mobile level and then at a desktop level to keep with the Mobile First design approach.

As is to be expected certain elements present in the wireframes did not make it into the project itself but may yet do so further down the line.

You can find my wireframes [here](https://github.com/Magnusson95/Dance-Your-Way/tree/master/wireframes).

## Testing

##### Internet Browsers

The same process of opening up the live page and meticulously clicking all links, buttons, and re-sizing of windows was utilized in the following browsers:

- Google Chrome - Main browser of choice for development.
- Microsoft Edge â€“ All working as intended besides flex at minimum width
- Mozilla Firefox - No issues. Everything works as intended.
- Safari - All working as intended.

The site has been tested physically on a number of mobile devices including:

- iPhone 5, 7, 10 and 11
- Google Pixel
- Galaxy S9.

Various examples of multiple screen sizes on different pages of the site can be found [here](#)

Javascript tested through user testing during each stage of writting. Including confirmation of API connection, API verification, API customisation and user testing of jQuery with Google Chrome Developer Tools.

Initial links to the Tableau API did not work, but the removal of jQuery and implementation of pure Javascript, plus a new API key, fixed this issue.

API customisation of of the Tableau Dashboard included some sizing issues, especially when on smaller devices. Each device size was tested individually for rendering issues and subsequently fixed.

Google Maps API saw no major issues. The Code Institute training was used to implement this API and then further customisation was done through the Google Maps API documentation, meaning no bugs occurred during testing.

Email JS API saw some minor issues with verification of the API link, this was rectified through resubmitting the API link. Bug messages were built in for successful or unsuccessful runs of the API. This was tested in a number of ways, from various devices and consol messages were checked.

Speed was also tested using [Pingdom](#) and the site received a performance grade of #/100
